# recurrent-net-backprop
This code is to illustrate the backpropagation in a recurrent neural network. In this problem, an RNN learns to predict a vector of sinusoids. The file `plots.pdf` shows intermediate results. `main_tf.py` contains the equivalent TensorFlow version where you can vary the batch size. Also checkout `main_tf_lstm.py` for LSTM version.
